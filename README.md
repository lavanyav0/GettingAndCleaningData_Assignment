Please read CodeBook.md for a complete description of what was done for this assignment. The README file only contains a brief summary

The peer graded assignment in the Coursera course, "Getting and Cleaning Data" requires us to demonstrate that we can download and combine data from different pieces in the provided input, add meaningful column names and metrics, and create a tidy data set as the output.

These files have been submitted for the assignment:

1) run_analysis.R - has the R code for the assignment

2) CodeBook.Rmd for knitr in R studio to generate CodeBook.md and Codebook.html - this is the document you are reading now, that describes what was done for this assignment

3) README.md - because the assignment requires it, but which points to this page

4) out_mean_data.txt - which contains the output tidy data set for this assignment

5) features_info.txt - this was included in the downloaded input and has the best explanation of the meaning of the accelerometer and gyroscope variables in the output tidy data set. It is included here for completeness
